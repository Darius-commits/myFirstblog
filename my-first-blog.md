# My day in May today 5/14/20

Today is a good day, I am feeling a little nervous because I have alot to do. I am facinated by life and by the myriad of interaction we have everyday. **Meaning:** Just a few days ago I got really mad at my cousin. 
I think about how from a zen perspective we are just a reflection of god and how everyone is just a reflection of us. With this in mind you don't really want to cause harm to another. 

It gets very _weird_ when I factor in the political nature of society these days. Though it must have always been a bit odd for any person at anytime. 


## Working out and drinking water

It's important to work out, and important to drink water.
